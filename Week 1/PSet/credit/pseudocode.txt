ask user for credit card number (use get_long)
analyze the number using the if its fake or real (use the modulus operator 10 divide by 100 repeat till its bigger than 0)
do the same for the second sum start by dividing it by 10

check credit card length
iterate through the cc and divide by 10 increment (till its smaller than 100) length if its smaller than the threshhold fake

get the first two digits compare with length
print the card type (AMEX\n)
